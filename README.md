# Software Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my developer portfolio project! This project, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), serves as a showcase of my skills, qualifications, and experience. Feel free to explore and learn more about my journey.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash - zsh - cmd
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
## View pages

Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying home/components/. All components are included into the page.tsx at the app level.

Go to the app/certificates/page.tsx if you want to view and edit certificates page, aslo you can see other components under the certificates/components dir.

This project leverages next/font for automatic optimization and loading of Raleway, a custom Google Font.
