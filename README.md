# Developer Portfolio - Next.js Project

Welcome to my developer portfolio project! This project, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), serves as a showcase of my skills, qualifications, and experience. Feel free to explore and learn more about my journey.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx, and the page will auto-update as you make changes.

This project leverages next/font for automatic optimization and loading of Inter, a custom Google Font.
